# Tomb4Plus
## Extended open source Tomb Raider Level Editor reimplementation

Tomb4Plus is a fork of Troye's [Tomb4](https://github.com/Trxyebeep/TOMB4) project, with the intention of extending the project to support the functionality of the Tomb Raider Level Editor and its associated binary-patched derivatives. The intention is to provide backwards compatibility with as many custom Tomb Raider levels built on the Tomb Raider 4 engine as possible, as well as provide bug fixes and compatibility improvements for modern operating systems. Visit this repo for additional tools (https://github.com/SaracenOne/tomb4_feature_extractor)

### Goals
Reimplement the functionality of Tomb Raider Level Editor with support for extended functionality from Tomb Raider Next Generation (TRNG), Tomb Raider Engine Patcher (TREP), FLEP (FLExible Patcher), and associated TRNG plugins.
